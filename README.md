git clone <https://github.com/delvalj/API-Rick_and_morty>

## Installing

Open the terminal and run:

## Starting

### Open the project in LocalHost:

In the terminal:

- npm run serve

## Deployment

In order to deploy the project i used the Firesbase Hosting option.
In your local console in Firebase you have the option HOSTING. Go for it.

After that you ll have to install some things to make it work...

- npm run build

After you are done with these you ll find a new directory called DIST. This is the project with all the optimization needed for firebase.

Then, following Firebase instructions

- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login
- firebase init
- firebase deploy
